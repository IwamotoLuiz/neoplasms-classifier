# Neoplasms Classifier
This project is part of my Undergraduate Thesis (TCC) in Information Systems at UNESP. The goal is to classify skin neoplasms as benign or malignant using Machine Learning techniques. The model leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to improve classification accuracy.
